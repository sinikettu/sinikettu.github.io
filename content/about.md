Hi,

My name is Przemys≈Çaw (or Przemo - for short) and I create stories. Everything I do has a story and every story should be fascinating. No mather if this is a product or work of art.

This webpage contains compilation of works of varying in nature. These projects were created on the basis of the experience I've gained during my professional career, their shape is also influenced by my interests in areas such as art history, literary history and cultural anthropology. 

I like to deal with the overall creation of communication, which is why this set of graphic projects is complemented by my text samples, containing a set of works in the fields of copywriting and storytelling. However, this is a separate document that I will provide upon request.
